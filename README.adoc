The purpose of these plugins is to bundle useful [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/)
functionality for JRuby projects. Use of this plugin replaces the need for both link::http://bundler.io[Bundler] and link::https://github.com/jruby/warbler[Warbler].


The Ruby gem dependency code for this project relies on the link::http://rubygems.lasagna.io/proxy/maven/releases[Rubygems Maven
proxy] operated by link::https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy]


This repository contains the:

* `base` (in `jruby-gradle-base-plugin/`): dependency resolution, executing Ruby, etc.
* `jar` (in `jruby-gradle-jar-plugin/`):  packaging JRuby-based `.jar` files
* `war` (in `jruby-gradle-war-plugin/`): packaging JRuby-based `.war` files
